For all of our data we made it numerical so we took lists of different qualitative data and numbered them 1-# of variables in the data. 
We also grouped a lot of the data together so for example for race, bi/multi race of any kind is counted as one variable, that way there weren't as many hyper specific variables making it easier to understand. We also shortened each variable to one or a few words each and explained them in our variable description, for example voting_record is percentage of votes they participated in in Congress and bills are the amount of bills they have sponsored.
